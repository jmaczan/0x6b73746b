# 0x6b73746b
The 0x6b73746b Programming Language

Based on https://craftinginterpreters.com/ and Lox Language

## Log

This README is also a log of how the language is built and what I learn during this. It serves me as a notes to memorize new things better and be able to get back to them easier

self-hosting - it's when a compiles of language X is written in language X

bootstrapping - it's when you use a language Y to compile a compiler of language X, which now can compile compilers for language X, so a former compiler of language Y is not needed anymore

language is too long word for this log, I replace it with lang since now
